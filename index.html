 <h1>Ninis' project</h1>
 <hr />
 <p>
    Hi, my name is Nini.
    This is my second website ever.
    Well, right now, we are in quarentine beacause of covid19.
    This time is very boring and lonely. 
    No on gets to see anyone else out of the house.
    And this was my friends and my last year at our school, next year we go to Branton school. 
    So now we shall never finish our last year at our school, our last year as all of us together, and we will never get our fairwell assemble or be sportsday team leaders.
    We don't ever get to walk back in that school ever again ðŸ˜¢. 
    My dog is the only one happy, because she loves that the hole family is home to cuddle and take care of her.
    For my dad this is pretty much the same because he is a programmer and he works from home, the difference is that our dog isn't down in his office as much.
    It has been four weeks, and everyone is already psycho. 
    there has been a bit more of work since about a week ago, because my teacher has givin us work to do and we have weekly meetings in small and large groups. 
    It isn't too much work compared to usual schoolwork, but it feels like it is.
    My friends and I are a bit worried about next year, since we're going to a new school.
    Only two of my close friends are coming with me  to that school. 
    Even if my sister is going to be in grade nine next year at the same school, it isn't like she's going to care that I'm there. 
    It's scary what's happening, but we just need to whatch out for one another and stay clean. Hopefuly this will blow over by summer time.
